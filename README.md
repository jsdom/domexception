# domexception is deprecated

This package implemented the [`DOMException`](https://webidl.spec.whatwg.org/#idl-DOMException) class, from the Web IDL Standard. However, it is no longer supported or maintained. Instead, consider using your platform's native implementation of `DOMException`, such as on:

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/api/globals.html#domexception)
* [The web](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/DOMException)

To browse code from previous versions, see [Git history](https://github.com/jsdom/domexception/tree/29ea43cc590749551ee92582a58f9517074c543f).
